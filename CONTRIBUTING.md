# Contribution Guidelines
Adonis is an ever expanding, frequently updated, slightly complicated, system. In order to keep Adonis functional and somewhat readabled rather than a tangled mess, here are some guidelines to consider before submitting a pull request, in the form of a FAQ:

## What can I contribute?
Anything within reason! Contributions can be to Adonis itself or the wiki (or both!) As long as your addition is useful and doesn't break something, and makes sense (while not violating ROBLOX's rules) it will *probably* be merged, however occasionally I might deem something unneccessary or incomplete, at which point I'll *probably* comment on the request for you to respond (or just so you know my reasoning.)

## What can't I contribute?
Anything that violates ROBLOX's rules (as in, anything that could get me/Adonis in trouble) is not allowed for obvious reasons. Also, please do not submit obfuscated code. If I cannot see/read/understand your contribution, I can't be sure it's not doing anything malicious (and can't debug it later if something happens) and will just close the request.

There is a very clear/obvious difference between unavoidably complex code and intentionally complicated code. I check all file changes before merging and can *usually* spot something abnormal quickly. 

## Is there anything that will *probably* get declined?
It depends. If it's something really stupid or that just doesn't make sense, then yeah. If for some reason I think the contribution is not worth adding in its current state I will make that known in the form of a comment for your review. If it's something that can be changed, you can always change it and I'll review it again after you do.

## What are some things I should watch out for when submitting my changes?
Bugs! If you are submitting code changes, please be sure to TEST THEM BEFORE SUBMITTING THEM! I don't want to spend an hour debugging your contribution when merging changes into the model. 

Also, try to double check any text for spelling issues. I frequently make typos/mistakes, so it's not a huge deal if you miss something, but a wholly incoherent string of letters and words is not acceptable. 

## What can I contribute to the Wiki?
Wiki contributions should focus on technical information, such as what various functions and variables do/are for and how to use them correctly when creating plugins. Information about Adonis and useful tutorials for new or inexperienced users is also acceptable (and much welcomed.)

## My contribution was accepted. Now what?
When I merge contributions, I open studio and manually update each changed file as well as the changelog. Due to some issue with the (current) size of the Commands module (I think(?)) automating this process (currently) runs into some issues.

When I handle the merge, I will also add you to the credits as "@GitHub YourGitHubUsernameHere" if it's your first contribution. If I forget to do this, and you notice, just let me know and I'll fix it.

Once I finish merging changes, I'll do some quick minor testing to make sure everything still works correctly. Once that's done, I'll upload the updated models, after which all new servers will be running the latest version. 

## How do I get the "GitHub Contributor" roles?
After your contribution is accepted, message me on the server and I'll give you the role. If you'd also like the Contributor rank in the Roblox group make sure you join the group (https://www.roblox.com/groups/886423/Epix-Incorporated#!/about) and DM me on Discord (Sceleratis#0001).


### That's all, folks!
