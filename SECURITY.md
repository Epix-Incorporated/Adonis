# 🛡️ Adonis Repository Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the *live* (release) version of Adonis is officially supported and given security updates when necessary.

[Supported Loader *(use this)*](https://www.roblox.com/library/7510622625) | [Supported MainModule (source)](https://www.roblox.com/library/7510592873)

Older versions of Adonis are not maintained/updated; hence, we do *not* recommend using those versions as they may contain a larger number of unpatched vulnerabilities (and bugs).

## Reporting a Vulnerability in Adonis

👉 **If the vulnerability is *severe* or highly damaging**, join the [Epix Incorporated Discord server](https://discord.gg/H5RvTP3) and DM an *Adonis Maintainer*.

👉 **If the vulnerability is relatively minor and can be safely discussed in public**, create a bug report [on GitHub](https://github.com/Epix-Incorporated/Adonis/issues/new/choose) or in our Discord server.

Be sure to include the following info in your report:
* when the vulnerability was discovered or first known;
* what is the potential impact (consequence) of the vulnerability; and
* how the vulnerability may be exploited.

Adonis Maintainers will investigate each vulnerability report and provide a fix at the earliest possible opportunity where necessary.
