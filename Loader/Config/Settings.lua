----------	Basics of Luau code	----------
------------------------------------------

--[[

	This is only here to help you when editing settings so you understand how they work.
	And don't break something.

	In case you don't know what Luau is; Luau is the scripting language Roblox uses...
	so every script you see (such as this one) and pretty much any code on Roblox is
	written in Luau.

	Anything that looks like {} is known as a table.
	Tables contain things, like the Luau version of a box.
	An example of a table would be setting = {"John", "Mary", "Bill"}
	You can have tables inside of tables, such in the case of setting = {{Group = 1234, Rank = 123, Type = "Admin"}}
	Just like real boxes, tables can contain pretty much anything including other tables.

	Note: Commas (,) as well as semicolons (;) can both be used to separate things inside a table.

	Anything that looks like "Bob" is what's known as a string. Strings
	are basically plain text; setting = "Bob" would be correct however
	setting = Bob would not; because if it's not surrounded by quotes Luau will think
	that Bob is a variable; Quotes indicate something is a string and therefore not a variable/number/code

	Numbers do not use quotes. setting = 56

	This green block of text you are reading is called a comment. It's like a message
	from the programmer to anyone who reads their stuff. Anything in a comment will
	not be seen by Luau when the script is run.


	Built-In Permissions Levels:
		Players - 0
		Moderators - 100
		Admins - 200
		HeadAdmins - 300
		Creators - 900

	Note that when changing command permissions you MUST include the prefix;
	So if you change the prefix to $ you would need to do $ff instead of :ff


	------------------------------------------
	------------	Trello		--------------
	------------------------------------------

	The Trello abilities of the script allow you to manage lists and permissions via
	a Trello board; The following will guide you through the process of setting up a board;

		1. Sign up for an account at http://trello.com
		2. Create a new board
			http://prntscr.com/b9xljn
			http://prntscr.com/b9xm53
		3. Get the board ID;
			http://prntscr.com/b9xngo
		4. Set settings.Trello_Primary to your board ID
		5. Set settings.Trello.Enabled to true
		6. Congrats! The board is ready to be used;
		7. Create a list and add cards to it;
			http://prntscr.com/b9xswk

	- You can view lists in-game using :viewlist ListNameHere

	Lists:
		Moderators - Card Format: Same as settings.Moderators
		Admins - Card Format: Same as settings.Admins
		HeadAdmins - Card Format: Same as settings.HeadAdmins
		Creators - Card Format: Same as settings.Creators
		Banlist - Card Format: Same as settings.Banned
		Mutelist - Card Format: Same as settings.Muted
		Blacklist - Card Format: Same as settings.Blacklist
		Whitelist - Card Format: Same as settings.Whitelist
		Permissions - Card Format: Same as settings.Permissions
		Music - Card Format: SongName:AudioID
		Commands - Card Format: Command (e.g. :ff bob)

	Card format refers to how card names should look.

	--// How to add administrators \\--

	Below are the administrator permission levels/ranks (Mods, Admins, HeadAdmins, Creators, StuffYouAdd, etc)
	Simply place users into the respective "Users" table for whatever level/rank you want to give them.

	Format Example:
		settings.Ranks = {
			["Moderators"] = {
				Level = 100;
				Users = {"Username"; "Username:UserId"; UserId; "Group:GroupId:GroupRank"; "Group:GroupId"; "Item:ItemID"; "GamePass:GamePassID";}
			};
			
			["ExampleCustomRank"] = {
				Level = 150;
				Users = {"Username"; "Username:UserId"; UserId; "Group:GroupId:GroupRank"; "Group:GroupId"; "Item:ItemID"; "GamePass:GamePassID";}
			};
		}

	If you use custom ranks, existing custom ranks will be imported with a level of 1.
	Add all new CustomRanks to the table below with the respective level you want them to be.

	NOTE: Changing the level of built-in ranks (Moderators, Admins, HeadAdmins, Creators)
	- Will also change the permission level for any built-in commands associated with that rank.


	MAKE SURE YOU SET settings.DataStoreKey TO SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY RANDOM!!
