		--// Basic Lua Info

		This is only here to help you when editing settings so you understand how they work
		and don't break something.

		Anything that looks like setting = {} is known as a table.
		Tables contain things; like the Lua version of a box.
		An example of a table would be setting = {"John","Mary","Bill"}
		You can have tables inside of tables, such in the case of setting = {{Group=1234,Rank=123,Type="Admin"}}
		Just like real boxes, tables can contain pretty much anything including other tables.

		Anything that looks like "Bob" is what's known as a string. Strings
		are basically plain text; setting = "Bob" would be correct however
		setting = Bob would not; because if it's not surrounded by quotes Lua will think
		that Bob is a variable; Quotes indicate something is a string and therefor not a variable/number/code

		Numbers do not use quotes. setting = 56

		This green block of text you are reading is called a comment. It's like a message
		from the programmer to anyone who reads their stuff. Anything in a comment will
		not be seen by Lua.

		Incase you don't know what Lua is; Lua is the scripting language Roblox uses...
		so every script you see (such as this one) and pretty much any code on Roblox is
		written in Lua.




		--// Settings [READ IF CONFUSED]

		If you see something like "Format: 'Username:UserId'" it means that anything you put
		in that table must follow one of the formats next to Format:

		For instance if I wanted to give admin to a player using their username, userid, a group they are in
		or an item they own I would do the following with the settings.Admins table:

		The format for the Admins' table's entries is "Username"; or "Username:UserId"; or UserId; or "Group:GroupId:GroupRank" or "Item:ItemID"
		This means that if I want to admin Bobjenkins123 who has a userId of 1234567, is in
		group "BobFans" (group ID 7463213) under the rank number 234, or owns the item belonging to ID 1237465
		I can do any of the following:

		settings.Admins = {"Bobjenkins123","Bobjenkins123:1234567",1234567,"Group:BobFans:7463213:234","Item:1237465"}


		If I wanted to make it so rank 134 in group 1029934 and BobJenkins123 had mod admin I would do
		settings.Moderators = {"Group:1029943:134","BobJenkins123"}


		I was going to change the admin rank stuff but I figured it would confuse people too much, so I left it as mods/admins/HeadAdmins ;p


		--// Admins

			settings.Moderators = {"Sceleratis";"BobJenkins:1237123";1237666;"Group:181:255";"Item:1234567"}
				This will make the person with the username Sceleratis, or the name BobJenkins, or the ID 1237123 OR 123766,
				   or is in group 181 in the rank 255, or owns the item belonging to the ID 1234567 a moderator

				If I wanted to give the rank 121 in group 181 Owner admin I would do:
				   settings.HeadAdmins = {"Group:181:121"}
				   See? Not so hard is it?

				If I wanted to add group 181 and all ranks in it to the :slock whitelist I would do;
					settings.Whitelist = {"Group:181";}

				I can do the above if I wanted to give everyone in a group admin for any of the other admin tables



		--// Command Permissions

			You can set the permission level for specific commands using setting.Permissions
			If I wanted to make it so only HeadAdmins+ can use :ff player then I would do:

				settings.Permissions = {"ff:HeadAdmins"}

				ff is the Command ":ff scel" and HeadAdmins is the NewLevel

				Built-In Permissions Levels:
					Players - 0
					Moderators - 100
					Admins - 200
					HeadAdmins - 300
					Creators - 900

				Note that when changing command permissions you MUST include the prefix;
				So if you change the prefix to $ you would need to do $ff instead of :ff


		--// Trello

			The Trello abilities of the script allow you to manage lists and permissions via
			a Trello board; The following will guide you through the process of setting up a board;

				1. Sign up for an account at http://trello.com
				2. Create a new board
					http://prntscr.com/b9xljn
					http://prntscr.com/b9xm53
				3. Get the board ID;
					http://prntscr.com/b9xngo
				4. Set settings.Trello_Primary to your board ID
				5. Set settings.Trello.Enabled to true
				6. Congrats! The board is ready to be used;
				7. Create a list and add cards to it;
					http://prntscr.com/b9xswk

				- You can view lists in-game using :viewlist ListNameHere

			Lists:
				Moderators			- Card Format: Same as settings.Moderators
				Admins				- Card Format: Same as settings.Admins
				HeadAdmins				- Card Format: Same as settings.HeadAdmins
				Creators			- Card Format: Same as settings.Creators
				Agents				- Card Format: Same as settings.Admins
				Banlist				- Card Format: Same as settings.Banned
				Mutelist			- Card Format: Same as settings.Muted
				Blacklist			- Card Format: Same as settings.Blacklist
				Whitelist			- Card Format: Same as settings.Whitelist
				Permissions			- Card Format: Same as settings.Permissions
				Music				- Card Format: SongName:AudioID
				Commands			- Card Format: Command  (eg. :ff bob)

			Card format refers to how card names should look

	**HOW TO ADD ADMINISTRATORS:**
		Below are the administrator permission levels/ranks (Mods, Admins, HeadAdmins, Creators, StuffYouAdd, etc)
		Simply place users into the respective "Users" table for whatever level/rank you want to give them.

		Format Example:
			settings.Ranks = {
				["Moderators"] = {
					Level = 100;
					Users = {"Username"; "Username:UserId"; UserId; "Group:GroupId:GroupRank"; "Group:GroupId"; "Item:ItemID"; "GamePass:GamePassID";}
				}
			}

		If you use custom ranks, existing custom ranks will be imported with a level of 1.
		Add all new CustomRanks to the table below with the respective level you want them to be.

	NOTE: Changing the level of built in ranks (Moderators, Admins, HeadAdmins, Creators)
				will also change the permission level for any built-in commands associated with that rank. 																																				-			-]]

				--// Add users here

			Users = {
				--// Add users here
			};
		};

		["HeadAdmins"] = {
			Level = 300;
		 	Users = {
				--// Add users here
			};
		};

		["Creators"] = {
			Level = 900; --// Anything 900 or higher will be considered a creator and will bypass all perms & be allowed to edit settings in-game.
			Users = {
				--// Add users here (Also, don't forget quotations and all that)
			};
		};
	};

	--// Use the below table to set command permissions; Commented commands are included for example purposes
	settings.Permissions = {
		-- "ff:HeadAdmins"; --// Changes :ff to HeadAdmins and higher (HeadAdmins = Level 300 by default)
		-- "kill:300"; --// Changes :kill to level 300 and higher (Level 300 = HeadAdmins by default)
		-- "ban:200,300" --// Makes it so :ban is only usable by levels 200 and 300 specifically (nothing higher or lower or in between)
	};	-- Format: {"Command:NewLevel"; "Command:Customrank1,Customrank2,Customrank3";}

			-- Alternative option: AdminLevel = "Moderators"
			Filter = true;									--// Should user supplied text passed to this command be filtered automatically? Use this if you plan to display a user-defined message to other players
			Hidden = true;									--// Should this command be hidden from the command list?
			Function = function(plr, args, data)	--// The command's function; This is the actual code of the command which runs when you run the command
				--// "plr" is the player running the command
