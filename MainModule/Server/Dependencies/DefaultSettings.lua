-- SETTINGS --
--------------
																																																																				--[[																												
		
		--// Basic Lua Info
		
		This is only here to help you when editing settings so you understand how they work
		and don't break something.		
		
		Anything that looks like setting = {} is known as a table.
		Tables contain things; like the Lua version of a box.
		An example of a table would be setting = {"John","Mary","Bill"}
		You can have tables inside of tables, such in the case of setting = {{Group=1234,Rank=123,Type="Admin"}}
		Just like real boxes, tables can contain pretty much anything including other tables.
		
		Anything that looks like "Bob" is what's known as a string. Strings
		are basically plain text; setting = "Bob" would be correct however
		setting = Bob would not; because if it's not surrounded by quotes Lua will think
		that Bob is a variable; Quotes indicate something is a string and therefor not a variable/number/code
		
		Numbers do not use quotes. setting = 56 
		
		This green block of text you are reading is called a comment. It's like a message
		from the programmer to anyone who reads their stuff. Anything in a comment will 
		not be seen by Lua. 
		
		Incase you don't know what Lua is; Lua is the scripting language Roblox uses... 
		so every script you see (such as this one) and pretty much any code on Roblox is
		written in Lua. 
		
		
		
		
		--// Settings [READ IF CONFUSED]
		
		If you see something like "Format: 'Username:UserId'" it means that anything you put
		in that table must follow one of the formats next to Format:
		
		For instance if I wanted to give admin to a player using their username, userid, a group they are in
		or an item they own I would do the following with the settings.Admins table:
		
		The format for the Admins' table's entries is "Username"; or "Username:UserId"; or UserId; or "Group:GroupId:GroupRank" or "Item:ItemID"
		This means that if I want to admin Bobjenkins123 who has a userId of 1234567, is in 
		group "BobFans" (group ID 7463213) under the rank number 234, or owns the item belonging to ID 1237465 
		I can do any of the following:
		
		settings.Admins = {"Bobjenkins123","Bobjenkins123:1234567",1234567,"Group:BobFans:7463213:234","Item:1237465"}
		
		
		If I wanted to make it so rank 134 in group 1029934 and BobJenkins123 had mod admin I would do
		settings.Moderators = {"Group:1029943:134","BobJenkins123"}
		
		
		I was going to change the admin rank stuff but I figured it would confuse people too much, so I left it as mods/admins/owners ;p


		--// Admins
		
			settings.Moderators = {"Sceleratis";"BobJenkins:1237123";1237666;"Group:181:255";"Item:1234567"}
				This will make the person with the username Sceleratis, or the name BobJenkins, or the ID 1237123 OR 123766, 
				   or is in group 181 in the rank 255, or owns the item belonging to the ID 1234567 a moderator
				
				If I wanted to give the rank 121 in group 181 Owner admin I would do:
				   settings.Owners = {"Group:181:121"}
				   See? Not so hard is it?
				
				If I wanted to add group 181 and all ranks in it to the :slock whitelist I would do;
					settings.Whitelist = {"Group:181";}
					
				I can do the above if I wanted to give everyone in a group admin for any of the other admin tables
		
		
		
		--// Command Permissions
			
			You can set the permission level for specific commands using setting.Permissions
			If I wanted to make it so only owners+ can use :ff player then I would do:
			
				settings.Permissions = {":ff:Owners"}
				
				:ff is the Command ":ff scel" and 3 is the NewLevel
				
				Permissions Levels:
					Players
					Moderators
					Admins
					Owners
					Creators
					
				Note that when changing command permissions you MUST include the prefix;
				So if you change the prefix to $ you would need to do $ff instead of :ff
				
		
		--// Trello
		
			The Trello abilities of the script allow you to manage lists and permissions via
			a Trello board; The following will guide you through the process of setting up a board;
			
				1. Sign up for an account at http://trello.com
				2. Create a new board
					http://prntscr.com/b9xljn
					http://prntscr.com/b9xm53
				3. Get the board ID;
					http://prntscr.com/b9xngo
				4. Set settings.Trello_Primary to your board ID
				5. Set settings.Trello.Enabled to true
				6. Congrats! The board is ready to be used;
				7. Create a list and add cards to it;
					http://prntscr.com/b9xswk
					
				- You can view lists in-game using :viewlist ListNameHere
					
			Lists:
				Moderators			- Card Format: Same as settings.Moderators
				Admins				- Card Format: Same as settings.Admins
				Owners				- Card Format: Same as settings.Owners
				Creators			- Card Format: Same as settings.Creators
				Agents				- Card Format: Same as settings.Admins
				Banlist				- Card Format: Same as settings.Banned
				Mutelist			- Card Format: Same as settings.Muted
				Blacklist			- Card Format: Same as settings.Blacklist
				Whitelist			- Card Format: Same as settings.Whitelist
				Permissions			- Card Format: Same as settings.Permissions
				Music				- Card Format: SongName:AudioID
				Commands			- Card Format: Command  (eg. :ff bob)
				
			Card format refers to how card names should look
