# Contributing to the Adonis Github Page.
### By pbstFusion.

Hello, welcome to the Adonis GitHub page. I know you want to get contributing to Adonis, but let's start things off first.

# What is  contributing?

Contruibuting is making a modification to a page. If this modification is accepted, then WOO HOO, you can ask Scel for the GitHub contributer role in the Epix Discord.

# How do I edit a page?

To contribute to the Adonis GitHub, find the page that you think could be modified. Click the button shaped like a pencil, and you've created a Fork of the page. Then, you can make any modifications you want to make, and press "Commit Changes". 

# How do I get this added to Adonis?

Once you have Commited the Changes, Scelaretis (the project owner) will review them, and if the edit/new page is found to be suitable, Scelaretis will merge the changes. Congratulations! You have gotten your edits added to the Adonis GitHub. You can now ask Scel for the Discord Contributer role. 

# No, I mean the actual in-game Adonis!

Once Scel does some super complicated stuff I don't understand and modifies the mainmodule/loader respectively.

# Are there any requirements for editing?

No. You can edit pages as you want, no formatting guide or anything. But make sure your changes work, or it won't work:tm:.

#### Congratulations, you finished this guide.
